solution step by step
HTML Structure: The form contains input fields for name, age, and a dropdown for selecting favorite color. It also includes a submit button.
CSS: Basic styling is applied for layout and form elements.
JavaScript: Event listener is added to the form submit event. When the form is submitted, JavaScript prevents the default form submission (which would refresh the page), retrieves input values, displays them in a <div> (#output), and changes the background color of the page based on the selected favorite color.
